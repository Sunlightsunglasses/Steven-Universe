# Steven-Universe

If you're evil and you're on the rise
You can count on the four of us taking you down
'Cause we're good and evil never beats us
We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas

We are the Crystal Gems
We'll always save the day!
And if you think we can't
We'll always find a way!
That's why the people of this world believe in
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven!

If you could only know, what we really are
When we arrived on Earth, from out beyond your star
We were amazed to find, your beauty and your worth
And we will protect your kind, and we will protect your Earth
And we will protect your Earth
And we will protect you!

I will fight for the place where I'm free
To live together and exist as me

I will fight in the name of Rose Quartz
And everything that she believed in

I will fight for the world I was made in
The Earth is everything I've ever known

I will fight to be everything that everybody wants me to be when I'm grown

The odds are against us, it won't be easy
But we're not going to do it alone

We are the Crystal Gems
We'll always save the day!
And if you think we can't
We'll always find a way
That's why the people of this world believe in
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven!
